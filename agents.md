# Instructions
I want to create a personal website for myself. It should be minimal, elegant, and tight. No tabs, just a single page is fine. I want to have a layout that is reminiscent of academic personal website roots, but with elements of design thinking and product sense, since this is what I am more responsible for now. 

# Design Considerations
I am a fan of the Helvetica Neue font, please use that. I am also a fan of an organic gradient type background, muted, with soft colors of pink, blue, green, and yellow. Bonus points if the gradient flows in the background.

## Highlight & accent colors
When you need a highlight, border, accent text, or subtle callout, only pull from this palette so the visuals stay cohesive:

- #F390CA
- #A3D576
- #FF9365
- #FFE15B
- #A3BEFA

## Typography guidelines
We are currently using Nunito (with Helvetica Neue and Arial as fallbacks) so the copy feels modern while still nodding to the Helvetica Neue inspiration. Maintain a disciplined type scale inspired by the Text Guidelines template shared in the screenshot:

- **Display** (hero name / top-most identifier): 48–72px range, 1.0 line height, sentence case.
- **Large header** (section-leading emphasis when needed): ~36–44px, 1.0 line height, sentence case.
- **Standard header** (default section titles): ~24–30px, 1.1–1.2 line height, sentence case.
- **Statement body copy** (opening paragraph or a single key idea): ~20px, 1.5 line height.
- **Large body copy** (supporting hero details): ~18px, 1.55–1.6 line height.
- **Medium body copy** (list titles, education details): ~17px, 1.5 line height.
- **Standard body copy** (most paragraphs): 16px, 1.6 line height.
- **Small callout copy** (footer or captions): 14–15px, 1.4 line height.

Try not to surface more than three distinct type sizes within a single viewport so the hierarchy stays crisp and legible.

The bottom should contain a smaller sentence that says:

## Introduction 
Hi! I'm Edwin, and I'm excited about AGI that benefits all of humanity.

I'm currently a Member of Technical Program Staff at OpenAI(openai.com), on the Foundations Research Team. My primary focus is on agentic capabilities, specifically on the high-risk/high-reward ideas that could shape the next decade of AI.

Separately, I enjoy tennis, guitar, and german shepherds.
