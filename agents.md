# Instructions
I want to create a personal website for myself. It should be minimal, elegant, and tight. No tabs, just a single page is fine. I want to have a layout that is reminiscent of academic personal website roots, but with elements of design thinking and product sense, since this is what I am more responsible for now. 

# Design Considerations
I am a fan of the Helvetica Neue font, please use that. I am also a fan of an organic gradient type background, muted, with soft colors of pink, blue, green, and yellow. Bonus points if the gradient flows in the background. 

The bottom should contain a smaller sentence that says:

## Introduction 
Hi! I'm Edwin, and I'm excited about AGI that benefits all of humanity.

I'm currently a Technical Program Manager at OpenAI(openai.com), on the Foundations Research Team. My primary focus is on agentic capabilities, specifically the high-risk/high-reward ideas that could shape the next decade of AI.

Separately, I enjoy tennis, guitar, and german shepherds.
